## Overview

### _Project Description_
Welcome to the final mandatory project - the Ping Pong Online Multiplayer Game! In this project, you will be creating a website that allows users to engage in real-time multiplayer Pong matches. The project encompasses the development of a user-friendly interface, an integrated chat system, and a seamless online gaming experience.

### _Technical Requirements_
To ensure uniformity and adherence to standards, the project has set the following technical requirements:

- PostgreSQL database usage exclusively.
- Single-page application structure for smooth navigation.
- Compatibility with the latest version of Google Chrome and an additional web browser.
- Error-free user experience with no unhandled errors or warnings.
- Deployment using a single call: `docker-compose up --build`.

## Security Concerns

To create a secure and fully functional website, you must address the following security concerns:
- Passwords stored in the database must be hashed.
- Protection against SQL injections.
- Implementation of server-side validation for forms and user input.
- Usage of a strong password hashing algorithm.
- Local storage of credentials, API keys, and environment variables in a `.env` file, excluded from version control.

## User Account

### _User Authentication_
- OAuth login system through the 42 intranet.
- User selection of a unique display name and avatar upload capability.
- Two-factor authentication options, such as Google Authenticator or phone-based methods.
- Ability to add friends, view their status, display user statistics, and match history.

## Chat

### _Chat Features_
- Creation of public, private, or password-protected channels.
- Direct messaging capabilities.
- User blocking functionality.
- Channel owner privileges, including setting passwords, changing them, and managing users.
- Invitation to Pong games and access to player profiles through the chat interface.

## Game

### _Pong Game_
- Live Pong gameplay versus other users on the website.
- Matchmaking system allowing users to join a queue and get automatically matched.
- Customization options, including power-ups or different maps.
- Responsive design considering network issues like unexpected disconnections or lag.

**Important Note:** The primary goal is to provide the best possible user experience throughout the entire website.
